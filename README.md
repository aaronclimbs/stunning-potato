Our application code name is "Stunning Potato". Our official title will be revealed at a later time.

The basic function of our application is to give the user drop down options with search parameters like wine type (red/white), 
, flavor, region, vintage, etc. and make an api call that displays wines that meet those search parameters sorted by rating. We will also use a map api that displays a pin where the wine is from.

We also have tabs at the top of the page that will display new wines, "trending wines", and top rated wines.

The API's we will be using are: Mapbox (for the map display), and Snooth for all the wine information.
