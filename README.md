# stunning-potato
GW Bootcamp Project 1
Group Members: Nico Alcalde, Aaron Keisler, Ashim Sharma, Tanika Williams

Our application code name is "Stunning Potato". Our official title will be revealed at a later time (Select Your Podcast, or SYP).

The basic function of our application is to give the user two distinct options to find a podcast most well suited to them. The first option is a search, which provides 10 podcast options based on the user's input. Additionally, we provide a set of books sourced from Google Books for more information on the requested topic. The second option is a drop-down menu of pre-curated podcast lists for the user to look through and choose a podcast. 

We will use Materialize CSS for the styling and will include mobile responsive navigation, collapsible menus, and modal animation.

The API's we will be using are: ListenNotes for the podcast search and curated lists, and Google Books for the book search.
